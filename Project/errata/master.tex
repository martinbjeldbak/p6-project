\section*{Distribution of individuals into species}
The formula for distributing neural networks into species (equation (3) on page 5) allows an individual to belong to multiple species.
As an example, consider a neural network $\ind$ with two output neurons $\nnout_1$ and $\nnout_2$, where $\nnout_1 = \nnout_2$ on some input $\ran$.
The binary representation of $1$ is \texttt{01}, which means that $\ind \in \speciesi{1}{\ran}$ if for any $j$, $\nnout_1 \geq \nnout_j$. This is indeed satisfied since all output neurons have the same value.
The binary representation of $3$ is \texttt{11}, which means that $\ind \in \speciesi{3}{\ran}$ if for any $j$, $\nnout_1 \geq \nnout_j \wedge \nnout_2 \geq \nnout_j$. This is indeed satisfied since all output neurons have the same value. We propose the following definition that corrects the above problem:

If $b_{m}b_{m-1}\dots b_1$ is the binary representation of a number $i$, we define the species \speciesi{i}{\ran} to contain any individual $\ind \in \indset$, that given $\ran$ as input satisfies
\begin{equation*}
  \forall j \in \left\{1, 2,\dots,m\right\}\left(b_j \rightarrow \left(\nnout_j = h\right) \land \neg b_j \rightarrow \left(\nnout_j < h\right)\right),
\end{equation*}
where $\nnout_k \in \nnoutset$ is the value of the $k$th output neuron of neural network \ind, and $h = \max\left\{\nnout_1, \nnout_2, \dots, \nnout_m\right\}$.

\section*{Initial similarity for 8-bit XOR}
The fitness-based plot for 8-bit XOR in figure 3 of page 9 is accidentally the same as the fitness-based plot for Snake. 
%This happened due to a typo in the way the plots are made. - I don't think we have to excuse why this happened
The 8-bit XOR plot should instead be as shown in figure~\ref{fig:initial-similarity-xor}.

\section*{Fitness plots}
NNTD was used as the diversity measure for the Mass Extinction Explore Exploit replacement rule (MEEE) in all the graphs of figures 5, 6, and 7.
