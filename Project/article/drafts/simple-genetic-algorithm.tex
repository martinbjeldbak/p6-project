\section{Simple Genetic Algorithms}
Defining generic, simple GAs will allow us to use them as a baseline for comparing maximum fitness with our diversity-hungry approach.

Size of population can be anything, usually 100, but should be the same as ours. Single point crossover with $P_c = 0.7$ is normal, where $P_m = 0.01$. Roulette-wheel selection is used as the selection scheme. In each generation, $80\%$ of the population is newly generated.
