Genetic algorithms rely on a number of individuals in a population that procreates to form more fit individuals. Offspring should ideally contain the best traits from both parents, hence a diverse set of individuals is crucial to identify the combination of traits that works best. If diversity is not maintained, only the local optimal solution of those traits available in the population will be explored, and a global optimal solution might not be found.

Many existing methods that aims to increase diversity require much greater computational power.
We propose a light weight method that is computationally inexpensive.
Common methods for measuring the phenotypic diversity of a population do only take into account the fitness of each individual.
We propose a method for measuring phenotypic diversity that takes into account the different traits among individuals.
