Genetic algorithms rely on a number of individuals in a population to procreate to create better, more fit individuals. Offspring should ideally contain the best traits from both parents, hence a diverse set of individuals is crucial to identify the combination of traits that works best. If diversity is not maintained, only the local optimal solution of those traits available in the population will be explored, and a global optimal solution might not be found.

Many existing methods aim to increase diversity require much more computational power \citpls{}. We wish to develop a lightweight method that is computationally inexpensive, yet maintains a high diversity in a population. Common methods for measuring the phenotypic diversity of a population only take into account the fitness of each individual \citpls{}. We develop a method for measuring phenotypic diversity that takes into account the different traits among individuals.
