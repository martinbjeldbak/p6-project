Genetic algorithms are used for search optimisation. A genetic algorithm consists of a number of individuals within one population. Each individual tries to solve a given problem optimally. Populations contain a set of individuals, where the individuals procreate by combining traits from the parents to create an offspring. The offspring has a slightly different set of traits than the parents. This slight difference might give it an advantage when trying to solve the given problem. If the offspring solves the given problem better than the parents did, then the fitness of the offspring will be higher than that of the parents, and we say that the offspring is more fit than the parent. 

Offspring should ideally contain the best traits from both parents, hence a diverse set of individuals is crucial to identify the combination of traits that work best. Consider a function for which the population must find a optimal solution for. If diversity is not maintained, only a local optimal solution of those traits available in the population will be explored, and a global optimal solution might not be found.

Diversity measures can be either genotypic of phenotypic. The former concerns different ways individuals are represented, while the latter is concerned with behavioural differences. Phenotypic diversity is often measured based on how fit each individual is. Two individuals with different traits do not necessarily have different fitness values. Consider two artificial intelligent (AI) players for the well-known cell phone game 'Snake'. We can calculate their fitness, based on how many pieces of food they collect before they die. One of the AI players may have traits that makes it good at avoiding death by not hitting any walls or its own body. Sometimes, by chance, it hits a piece of food. The other AI player may have traits that makes it good at searching for food. The two AI players can have the same fitness value, that is, they collect the same amount of food before they die, and still have completely different traits. Therefore, fitness-based diversity measures do not always catch the difference in traits among individuals.

We propose a new method for measuring phenotypic diversity, which we claim is more suitable for measuring diversity in genetic algorihtms that use neural networks, compared to fitness-based diversity measures. With ``more suitable'', we mean a diversity function that better reflects different traits among the individuals of a population.
We will call this measure \emph{Neural Network Trait Diversity} (NNTD). Futhermore, we propose a policy for how offspring is selected to form a the next generation of a population, which forces a higher NNTD. We call this selection policy \emph{Ancestor Elitism Selection Policy} (AESP).

Many existing methods which aim to increase diversity, require a lot of computational power \citpls{}. We will develop a method that is computationally inexpensive, yet maintains a high diversity in a population. Common methods for measuring the phenotypic diversity of a population only take into account the fitness of each individual \citpls{}. We develop a method for measuring phenotypic diversity that takes into account the different traits among individuals.
