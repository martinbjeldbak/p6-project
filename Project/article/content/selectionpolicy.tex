\section{Ancestor Elitism Replacement Rule}
In this section, we develop a new replacement rule, the Ancestor Elitism Replacement Rule (AERR). Given a generation of individuals, $G_k$, and their offspring, $O_k$, AERR dictates how the next generation $G_{k+1}$, is created. This procedure is shown in \cref{alg:aesp}.

In the algorithm, $i.\phi$ denotes the fitness of the individual $i$, $i.p_j$ denotes the $j$th parent of $i$, and $\rho$ denotes a random immigrant, which is a newly created individual with a random chromosome.
Briefly explained, any individual from the offspring that has only a single parent will replace that parent only if it is more fit than its parent. If it has two parents and is more fit than both of them, it will replace them both by itself and a random immigrant.
