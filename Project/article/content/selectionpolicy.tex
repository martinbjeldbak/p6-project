\section{Selection policy}
Offspring are produced in each iteration of a GA from a generation of individuals, which combined with the existing individuals, must form the next generation according to a selection policy. In some GA implementations, only the offspring is used for the next generation and all individuals of previous generations are discarded\footnote{ Give an example of such a selection policy}. Other common implementations form the next generation by selecting the best individuals from both the existing population and the offspring created\cite{masterThesisGANN}. Such a policy leads to homogeneous individuals and thus a low diversity due to the fact that the same, best individuals will with a large probability be selected as parents.

\subsection{Ancestor Elitism Selection Policy}
Given a generation of individuals $G_k$ and their offspring $O_k$, AESP creates the next generation, $G_{k+1}$, as shown in \cref{alg:aesp}.

In the algorithm, $i.\phi$ denotes the fitness of the individual $i$, $i.p_j$ denotes the $j$'th parent of $i$, and $\rho$ denotes a random immigrant, which is a newly created individual with a random chromosome.
