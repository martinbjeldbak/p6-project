We develop a new method for measuring phenotypic diversity, which we claim is more suitable for measuring diversity in genetic algorihtms that use neural networks as individuals, compared to other genotypic and phenotypic diversity measures. This method better reflects different traits among the individuals of a population. With this mthod, we explore how different replacement rules affect the diversity of a population.
