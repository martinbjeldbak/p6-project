\subsection{Problem statement}
\label{sec:problemstatement}


We develop a new method for measuring phenotypic diversity, which we claim is more suitable for measuring diversity in genetic algorihtms that use neural networks as individuals, compared to fitness-based diversity measures. With ``more suitable'', we mean a diversity function that better reflects different traits among the individuals of a population. We call this measure \emph{Neural Network Trait Diversity} (NNTD). We further explore how different replacement rules affect the diversity of a population.
