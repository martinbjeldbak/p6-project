\subsection{Continuous Diversity}
\label{sec:continuousdiversity}

We performed experiments to see how the diversity would change on three problems with four different replacement rules. We measured the average diversity of \num{100} runs of \num{2000} iterations. Each run initializes an entirely new population, and each population goes through \num{2000} iterations of procreation in the search for optimal solutions. After each iteration the diversity of the population is measured. We then took the average diversity of the \num{100} runs. These numbers shows us how the diversity is progressing with the different replacement rules for the different problems.

%how much did we do it
We use the average of the \num{100} runs, because we have randomness in our system. Each new population is initialized randomly. By taking the average we belive that we get a better picture of how the progression in diversity looks like.

%what were the results
In figure \emph{something} we see that bla bla\dots

This also means that bla bla\dots
%anything else?
