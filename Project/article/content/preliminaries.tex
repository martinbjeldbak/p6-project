\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

In this section we present the concepts used in this paper.
We begin with an introduction of artificial neural networks, followed by an introduction of genetic algorithms (GAs). 

%It is often argued that the weakness of GAs is the fall in diversity over generations, which can result in premature convergence~\cite{diaz2007empirical, 1266373,Zitzler00comparisonof}. 
%After presenting neural networks and GAs, we present methods used to overcome a decreasing diversity. Methods like crowding and
%use of special selection procedures are presented. Next, we introduce different methods of measuring diversity.

%We begin by presenting methods which propose solutions to overcome the decreasing nature of diversity in the populations.

%In this section we present the structure of artificial neural networks and concept of genetic algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of diversity measurement for genetic algorithms.
