\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

In the following sections we assume that the reader is familiar with neural networks and genetic algorithms. Otherwise, see \cref{ap:ann-ga} for explanations of these. 

In GAs, a high diversity among the individuals is important. It is often argued that the weakness of GAs is the fall in diversity over generations, which can result in premature convergence~\cite{diaz2007empirical, 1266373,Zitzler00comparisonof}.

We begin by presenting crowding methods, which use special selection procedures to overcome a decreasing diversity. Next, we introduce different methods of measuring diversity, and finish this section by explaining our own proposal for measuring diversity.

%We begin by presenting methods which propose solutions to overcome the decreasing nature of diversity in the populations.

%In this section we present the structure of artificial neural networks and concept of genetic algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of diversity measurement for genetic algorithms.
