\section{Future work}\label{sec:futurework}
Much research has already been done on determining how the tweaking of different parameters in a GA affect the fitness values achieved as well as undesirable convergence. The diversity measure \dia is a new tool for investigating the impact on behavioural differences when tweaking the parameters of a GA.
From our experiments, we saw that the Explore Exploit replacement rule produced the most fit individuals for all test cases.
Many other replacement rule exists that switches between exploration and exploitation phases based on changes in diversity.
It is unknown whether these replacement rules will produce more fit individuals by using \dia as a diversity measure.
\dia is not limited to be used in GAs only. In fact, it can be used anywhere where one wants to measure the behavioural differences between two or more neural networks. The many possible applications of \dia still has to be uncovered.
