\section{Neural Network Trait Diversity}
We propose a new method for measuring phenotypic diversity, which we claim is more suitable for measuring diversity in GA's using neural networks with binary output, compared to fitness based diversity measures. With \emph{more suitable}, we mean diversity function that better reflects different traits among the individuals of a population. 
We denote a diversity calculated using our method for a \emph{Neural Network Trait Diversity} (NNTM).
NNTD is calculated among the neural networks $F = \{f_1, f_2, ... f_n\}$, that all have the same architecture of $a$ input and $b$ output neurons. NNTD is based on the inputs $\{R_1, R_2, ..., R_m\}$, where each input is represented by an $a$-tuple of real values chosen randomly. NNTD uses Simpsons diversity index, which takes as input a total number of organisms $o$ as well as a distribution of organisms into a number of species $\{S_1, S_2, ..., S_k\}$, and returns a diversity index. Simpsons diversity index is used in ecology to quantify the biodiversity of a habitat and uses the term \emph{organism}, where we use the term \emph{individual} instead, which is the terminology used when describing genetic algorithms. 
For each input $R_1$, NNTD distributes the population of individuals into a number species $\{S_1, S_2, ..., S_k\}$, such that  each specie represents a possible output from the neural network architecture used by the individuals, thus $k = 2^b$. We denote $S_i(R)$ to be the number of individuals belonging to the $i$'th specie, given the input $R$.

\[S_i(R) = \{f_j \; | \; i = 2^0\sigma_{R,j,1} + 2^1\sigma_{R,j,2} + ... + 2^{b-1}\sigma_{R,j,b} \}\]

where $\sigma_{x,y,z} \in \{0, 1\}$ is the output of the $z$'th hidden neuron in neural network $f_y$ on input $x$, .

One disadvantage of $NNTD$ is that it relies on random inputs, which means that a lower value of $m$ causes more statistical uncertainty. A greater value of $m$ requires more computational power. Also, consider three neural networks which given the same input produces the outputs $\{0, 0, 0\}$, $\{0, 0, 1\}$ and $\{1, 1, 1\}$. All three neural networks belong to indifferent species even though the former two seems to be more similar because their outputs are more similar. This kind of similarity is not catched by NNTD. Also, NNTD is not suitable for neural networks with real valued outputs because of the infinite number of species this would result in. This can maybe be fixed by distributing the real valued output into a number of buckets, where each bucket represent a real valued range, we will however not look into this, but only focus on neural networks with binary outputs.
