\section{Neural Network Trait Diversity}
In the following, we present a diversity measure for GAs using neural networks, based on the Simpson index. We will thus use the term individual and neural network interchangeably. Let $F = \set{f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n}$, where each $F_j$ for $0 \leq j \leq n$ denote the set of neural networks contained in a population, which all have the same architecture of $a$ input and $b$ output neurons. 

Neural Network Trait Diversity (NNTD) is calculated with respect to a number of random inputs $\set{R_1, R_2, \dots, R_m}$, where each $R_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$ is an $a$-tuple of real values chosen randomly. For each sample $R_i$, a Simpson's Diversity Index (SDI) is calculated.

SDI is a diversity measure used in ecology to quantify the biodiversity of a habitat~\cite{simpson1949measurement}. The SDI measure is calculated with 
%
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:sdi}
  D = 1 - \left(\frac{\sum{s (s - 1)}}{S (S - 1)}\right) 
\end{equation*}
%
where $s$ is the total number of individuals of a particular species, and $S$ is the total number of individuals of all species. $D$ is calculated $m$ times, and the average of the $m$ SDI values will define the NNTD. We classify species of individuals using $S_k(R_i)$ as the set of neural networks belonging to the $k$th species with respect to input $R_i$.

We distribute the neural networks into species based on which one of their output neurons yields the highest value on input $R_i$. %This means that for any neural network belonging to species $S_k(R_i)$, the value of the $k$th output neuron will be greater than or equal to the value of any other output neuron given input $R_i$.
This definition implies that the number of species equals the number of output neurons $b$, e.g.\ $1 \leq k \leq b$. We distribute neural networks into a set of species as follows
%
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:species}
  S_k(R_i) = \setof{f_j}{\forall l \in \set{1, 2, \dots, b} \left(\sigma_{kji} \geq \sigma_{lji}\right)}
\end{equation*}
%

where $\sigma_{xyz} \in \set{0, 1}$ is the output of the $x$th neuron in neural network $f_y$ on input $R_z$.

This species classification implies that a single network can only be part of one species per input. One disadvantage of NNTD is that it relies on random inputs, which means that fewer random inputs implies less statistical significance.
