\section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}
In this section, we evaluate our proposed diversity measurement (\dia) by using it to measure diversity of a population in two different environments.

In the first environment, which we will refer to as the static environment, the GA will not iterate.
For three maximization problems we introduce in \cref{sec:problems}, we create an initial population using a constrain $c$, and a significance $\alpha$. We choose $c$ such that we have an intuition about how the behavioural diversity of individuals will be dependent on $\alpha$. By experiments, we will see if it is likely that \dia{} catches this dependency.

In the second environment, which we will refer to as the dynamic environment, we will let the GA run for a number of iterations on each of the three problems. 
For each problem, we will run the GA using each of the four replacement rules introduced in \cref{sec:replacementrules}.
During all of the tests, we will measure the diversity using each of the diversity measures described in \cref{sec:diversitymeasures}, as well as \dia.

We hope to see that the diversities returned by \dia{} better match the expected behavioural differences than any of the other diversity measures.

%All experiments are performed on three different discrete problems, which we describe in \cref{sec:problems}.

We use a population size of 100. For each iteration, 100 new offspring individuals are created. Half of the offsprings are cloned from a random parent. These are found by using a rank-based selection, and then mutated. The other half is made by performing crossover between two random parents, also using rank-based selection. These settings are presented in \cref{tab:gaparam}.

Three crossover methods are used: one-point crossover, two-point crossover, and uniform crossover. When a new individual is created using crossover, there is an equal chance for any of the crossover methods to be used. Each offspring created by crossover, has a \perc{10} chance to be mutated. When mutating an individual, each bit in its bit string has a \perc{5} chance to be assigned a random boolean value. For specific implementation details, we refer to the source code~\cite{mbm:kmc:ekoGA}.

\subsection{Overall results}
\todo{Skriv fælles træk ved dem alle}
Regardless of problem type, each diversity measure performs similarly.

It is clear from our experiments, that replacement rules play a very large part in how quickly large fitness values are found.
