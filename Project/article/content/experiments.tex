\section{Experiments}
In this section, we evaluate our developed diversity measurement method and comparison our AESP selection policy to crowding and xxx selection policies.

%During each generation, a defined number of crossover and mutation operators are applied.
Each of the experiments are set up to use the same configuration. Populations consist of \num{100} individuals, and upon creating a new population, rank-based selection is utilized on the current population $p$ to select individuals for crossover and mutation in population $p + 1$. Half of this new population is created from crossover between two selected parents in population $p$, the other half created solely by mutation of the individuals also in $p$. Of the individuals in population $p + 1$ belonging to the half created by crossover, there is a \perc{10} chance that the individual also will be selected for mutation. For each bit belonging to the individuals selected for mutation, there is a \perc{5} that bit will be selected for mutation. When a bit is selected for mutation, there is a \perc{50} chance it will stay the same, or be inverted.
