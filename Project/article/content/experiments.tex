\section{Experiments}
In this section, we evaluate our proposed diversity measurement (\dia) by using it to measure diversity of a population in two different environments.

In the static environment the GA will not iterate. We create an initial population using a constrain $c$, and a significance $\alpha$. We choose $c$ such that we have an intuition about how the behavioural diversity of individuals will be dependent on $\alpha$. By experiments, we will see if it is likely that \dia{} catches this dependency.

In the dynamic environment, we create a random initial population, and perform 2000 iterations for two larger data sets, and 500 iterations on the smaller data set using each of the  replacement rules described in \cref{sec:replacementrules}. We hope to find it likely that the diversities returned by \dia{} more intuitively follow the expected behavioural diversity for each replacement rule, compared to the other diversity measures.

%All experiments are performed on three different discrete problems, which we describe in \cref{sec:problems}.

We use a population size of 100. For each iteration, 100 new offspring individuals are created. Half of the offsprings are cloned from a random parent. These are found by using a rank-based selection, and then mutated. The other half is made by performing crossover between two random parents, also using rank-based selection. These settings are presented in \cref{tab:gaparam}.

Three crossover methods are used: one-point crossover, two-point crossover, and uniform crossover. When a new individual is created using crossover, there is an equal chance for any of the crossover methods to be used. Each offspring created by crossover, has a \perc{10} chance to be mutated. When mutating an individual, each bit in its bit string has a \perc{5} chance to be assigned a random boolean value. For specific implementation details, we refer to the source code~\cite{mbm:kmc:ekoGA}.

\subsection{Overall results}
\todo{Skriv fælles træk ved dem alle}
Regardless of problem type, each diversity measure performs similarly.

It is clear from our experiments, that replacement rules play a very large part in how quickly large fitness values are found.
