\section{Experiments}
In this section, we evaluate our proposed method of a better diversity measurement (NNTD), and compare our Ancestor Elitism Replacement Rule to a standard naive replacement rule as well as the probabilistic crowding replacement rule.

Each of the following experiments use the same configuration of certain variables. Populations consist of \num{100} individuals, and upon creating a new population, rank-based selection is utilized on the current population $p$ to select individuals for crossover and mutation to create offspring. Half of the offspring is created from crossover between two selected parents in population $p$, the other half created solely by mutation of the individuals also in $p$. Of the individuals in $p$'s offspring belonging to the half created by crossover, there is a \perc{10} chance that the individual also will be selected for mutation. For each bit belonging to the individuals selected for mutation, there is a \perc{5} chance for that bit to be selected for mutation. When a bit is selected for mutation, there is a \perc{50} chance it will remain the same, and a \perc{50} chance to be inverted.
