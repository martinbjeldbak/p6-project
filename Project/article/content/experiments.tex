\section{Experiments}
%In this section, we evaluate our proposed method of a better diversity measurement (NNTD) by using it to measure diversity of the replacement rules described in \cref{sec:replacementrules}. This is to compare each replacement rules' influence on diversity using NNTD.
Three problem instances are used to evaluate our diversity measure. Two problems discrete, and one continuous. A standard implementation of GAs, ANNs, replacement policies, and diversity measures is used (see~\cite{mbm:kmc:ekoGA} for the authors' implementation details).

    Generations per run (discrete) & 500 \\

We use a population size of 100. For each iteration, 100 new offspring individuals are created. Half of the offspring is cloned from a random parent, found using rank-based selection, and then mutated. The other half is made by performing crossover between two random parents, also using rank-based selection.
Three crossover methods are used: one-point crossover, two-point crossover, and uniform crossover. When a new individual is created using crossover, there is an equal chance for any of the crossover methods to be used. 
Each offspring individual created by crossover, has a \perc{10} chance to be mutated.
When mutating an individual, each bit in its bit string has a \perc{5} chance to be assigned a random boolean value.
