\section{Experiments}
%In this section, we evaluate our proposed method of a better diversity measurement (NNTD) by using it to measure diversity of the replacement rules described in \cref{sec:replacementrules}. This is to compare each replacement rules' influence on diversity using NNTD.
Three problems instances are used to evaluate our diversity measure. Two problems discrete, and one continuous. A standard implementation of GAs, ANNs, replacement policies, and diversity measures is used (see~\cite{mbm:kmc:ekoGA} for the authors' implementation details). 

\subsection{Parameter settings}

  \begin{tabular}{l S}
    \toprule
    Parameter & {Specification} \\
    \midrule
    Number of runs & 100 \\
    Generations per run (continuous) & 2000 \\
    Generations per run (discrete) & 500 \\
    Population size & 100 \\
    Selection method & {rank-based} \\

Three crossover methods are used: one-point crossover, two-point crossover, and uniform crossover. Upon creating a new population, there is an equal chance for each to be chosen.

Half of the offspring is created from crossover between two selected parents in population $p$, the other half created solely by mutation of the individuals also in $p$. Of the individuals in $p$'s offspring belonging to the half created by crossover, there is a \perc{10} chance that the individual also will be selected for mutation. For each bit belonging to the individuals selected for mutation, there is a \perc{5} chance that that will be mutated. Of the bits to be mutated, each bit has a \perc{50} chance it will remain the same, and a \perc{50} chance to be inverted.
