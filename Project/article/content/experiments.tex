\section{Experiments}
In this section, we evaluate our proposed method of a better diversity measurement (NNTD) by using it to measure diversity of the replacement rules described in \cref{sec:replacementrules}. This is to compare each replacement rules' influence on diversity using NNTD.

We perform our experiments on two different discrete problems, chosen based on their different characteristics.
The first problem is a classification problem over the Leaf dataset.
The second problem is making an AI player for the game Snake, which was found on many of the first cell phones.

We use a population size of 100. For each iteration, 100 new offspring individuals are created. Half of the offspring is cloned from a random parent, found using rank-based selection, and then mutated. The other half is made by performing crossover between two random parents, also using rank-based selection.
Three crossover methods are used: one-point crossover, two-point crossover, and uniform crossover. When a new individual is created using crossover, there is an equal chance for any of the crossover methods to be used. 
Each offspring individual created by crossover, has a \perc{10} chance to be mutated.
When mutating an individual, each bit in its bit string has a \perc{5} chance to be assigned a random boolean value.
For specific implementation details, see~\cite{mbm:kmc:ekoGA}.
