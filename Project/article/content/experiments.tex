\section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}
In this section, we evaluate our proposed diversity measurement (\dia) by using it to measure diversity of a population in two different environments.

In the first environment, which we refer to as the static environment, the GA does not iterate.
For the three maximization problems introduced in \cref{sec:problems}, we create an initial population using a constrain $c$, and a significance $\alpha$. We choose $c$ such that we have an intuition about how the behavioural diversity of individuals are dependent on $\alpha$. By experiments, we see if it is likely that \dia{} catches this dependency.

In the second environment, which we refer to as the dynamic environment, the GA runs for a number of iterations on each of the three problems. 
For each problem, we perform a test using each of the four replacement rules introduced in \cref{sec:replacementrules}.
During all of the tests, we measure the diversity using \dia{} as well as each of the diversity measures described in \cref{sec:diversitymeasures}.

By these experiments we can conclude whether the diversities returned by \dia{} better match the expected behavioural differences of the test cases, compared to the other diversity measures.

%All experiments are performed on three different discrete problems, which we describe in \cref{sec:problems}.

We use a population size of \num{100} individuals. For each iteration, \num{100} new offspring individuals are created. Half of the offspring is cloned from a random parent. These are found by using a rank-based selection, and then mutated. The other half is made by performing crossover between two random parents, also using rank-based selection. These settings are presented in \cref{tab:gaparam}.

Three crossover methods are used: one-point crossover, two-point crossover, and uniform crossover. When a new individual is chosen for creation using crossover, there is an equal chance for any of the crossover methods to be used. Each offspring created by crossover has a \perc{10} chance to be mutated. When mutating an individual, each bit in its bit string has a \perc{5} chance to be assigned a random boolean value. For specific implementation details, we refer to the source code~\cite{mbm:kmc:ekoGA}.
