\section{Experiments}
%In this section, we evaluate our proposed method of a better diversity measurement (NNTD) by using it to measure diversity of the replacement rules described in \cref{sec:replacementrules}. This is to compare each replacement rules' influence on diversity using NNTD.
Three problems instances are used to evaluate our diversity measure. Two problems discrete, and one continuous. A standard implementation of GAs, ANNs, replacement policies, and diversity measures is used (see~\cite{mbm:kmc:ekoGA} for the authors' implementation details). 

We collect \num{1000} independant runs over \num{51} generations for the discrete problems, and \num{1000} generations for the continuous problem.

Each of the problems use the following parameter variables. Populations consist of \num{100} individuals, and upon creating a new population, rank-based selection is utilized on the current population $p$ to select individuals for crossover and mutation to create offspring. Half of the offspring is created from crossover between two selected parents in population $p$, the other half created solely by mutation of the individuals also in $p$. Of the individuals in $p$'s offspring belonging to the half created by crossover, there is a \perc{10} chance that the individual also will be selected for mutation. For each bit belonging to the individuals selected for mutation, there is a \perc{5} chance that that will be mutated. Of the bits to be mutated, each bit has a \perc{50} chance it will remain the same, and a \perc{50} chance to be inverted.

What is interesting is the relative difference in diversity of the different methods.
