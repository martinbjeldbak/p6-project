  abstract = {In the field of Genetic Programming (GP), there has
                 been a growing interest in the effects of loss of
                 genetic diversity, which causes the whole population
                 prematurely converge to local optima. Improving
                 diversity of the population is always an implicit goal
                 of almost any basic genetic programming system. Most
                 research in this area suggests a diversity measurement
                 and controls this quantitative metric to maintain
                 genetically diverse populations. This paper brief
                 overviews of the measures used in Genetic Programming
                 for diversity maintenance and promotion.},
