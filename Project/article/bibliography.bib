  abstract = {In the field of Genetic Programming (GP), there has
                 been a growing interest in the effects of loss of
                 genetic diversity, which causes the whole population
                 prematurely converge to local optima. Improving
                 diversity of the population is always an implicit goal
                 of almost any basic genetic programming system. Most
                 research in this area suggests a diversity measurement
                 and controls this quantitative metric to maintain
                 genetically diverse populations. This paper brief
                 overviews of the measures used in Genetic Programming
                 for diversity maintenance and promotion.},

abstract={Examines measures of diversity in genetic programming. The goal is to understand the importance of such measures and their relationship with fitness. Diversity methods and measures from the literature are surveyed and a selected set of measures are applied to common standard problem instances in an experimental study. Results show the varying definitions and behaviors of diversity and the varying correlation between diversity and fitness during different stages of the evolutionary process. Populations in the genetic programming algorithm are shown to become structurally similar while maintaining a high amount of behavioral differences. Conclusions describe what measures are likely to be important for understanding and improving the search process and why diversity might have different meaning for different problem domains.},

pages={176-183}, 
abstract={This paper presents an adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) to near optimal solutions. The algorithm employs a unique decoding scheme with the integer strings. It also automatically adapts the crossover probability and the mutation rate to the changing population dynamics. The adaptive control maintains population diversity at user-defined levels, and therefore prevents premature convergence in search. Comparison between this algorithm and a normal fixed parameter GA clearly demonstrates the advantage of population diversity control. Our experiments with the 56 Solomon benchmark problems indicate that this algorithm is competitive and it paves way for future research on population-based adaptive genetic algorithm.},
