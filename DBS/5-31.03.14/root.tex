\section{Self Study 5: Mini-project part 4}
This self study was done on \formatdatewday{31}{3}{2014}. We first converted the IMDB MySQL dump to PosgresSQL and then mapped all the tables to our schema, before finally designing the queries described in the exercise document. The PostgreSQL dump of our converted schema can be found at this link: \url{https://bitbucket.org/Obeyed/p6-project/src/72274ff3487ef59dfd2782cb3a277775b179654c/DBS/5-31.03.14/ourimdb.sql?at=master}.

\subsection{Filling the database}
We use a Ruby gem (\url{https://github.com/maxlapshin/mysql2postgres}) to convert the MySQL dump of the IMDB database found on Moodle to a PostgreSQL database with the same tables and data. To ease transfer, we added the tables defined in \cref{fig:ss2-schema} of self study 2 in the same database and executed the \texttt{INSERT INTO} queries below to map the data from IMDB to our tables.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
INSERT INTO our_movie
SELECT title, language, year
FROM movie
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
INSERT INTO our_genre
SELECT DISTINCT genre
FROM genre
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
INSERT INTO "our_genreMovie"
SELECT genre.genre, movie.title, movie.year
FROM genre, movie
WHERE genre."movieId" = movie.id
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
INSERT INTO our_refers
SELECT m1.title, m2.title, m1.year, m2.year
FROM movieref, movie m1, movie m2
WHERE movieref."fromId" = m1.id AND movieref."toId" = m2.id
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
INSERT INTO our_person
SELECT id, birthdate, name, '', deathdate, gender
FROM person
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
INSERT INTO our_role
SELECT DISTINCT role
FROM involved
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
INSERT INTO our_participates
SELECT movie.title, involved.role, involved."personId", movie.year
FROM involved, movie
WHERE involved."movieId" = movie.id
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
INSERT INTO our_participates
SELECT movie.title, involved.role, involved."personId", movie.year
FROM involved, movie
WHERE involved."movieId" = movie.id
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
INSERT INTO our_user
SELECT DISTINCT "user", null, null
FROM ratings
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
INSERT INTO our_review
SELECT rating, "user", movie.title, null, movie.year
FROM ratings, movie
WHERE movie.id = ratings."movieId"
\end{lstlisting}

No data was present in the dump to identify awards given to movies.

Sometimes we have decided to drop the “date” attribute, rename it to ``year'' and change its type to int, causing the order of attributes to be rearranged.

There was no information about gender in the database, making it impossible to do any queries based on gender.

Upon mapping of the ‘ratings’ table in the IMDB database, we noticed out that our structure (as shown in figure 3) can uniquely identifiy ratings (reviews) merely by the user’s primary key: username, and the movie’s primary keys: title and date. This restricts the user in only being able to have one review per movie, which is what we wish and allows us to remove the ``id'' column.
